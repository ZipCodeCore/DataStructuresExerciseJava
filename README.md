# DataStructuresExerciseJava
Write you some data structuring structures.


Use this interface: [Interface Deque<E>](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html) and this concrete class,
[Class ArrayDeque<E>](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayDeque.html) to implement the methods in the Z* interfaces.

There are 3 interfaces in the `src/main/java` folder. You should implement the methods in the interfaces in the `src/main/java` folder within the 3 concrete implementations in the `src/main/java` folder.

Don't overthink it, look to build as simple as possible. Your code should be able to run the  test cases in the test folder.
