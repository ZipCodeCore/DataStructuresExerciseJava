# DataStructuresExerciseJava
Write you some data structuring structures.

Why not write some data structures in Java? But make it easy on yourself, use the Java Collections Framework to implement the data structures.

## But How?

Use this interface: [Interface Deque<E>](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html) and this concrete class,
[Class ArrayDeque<E>](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayDeque.html) to implement the methods in the Z* interfaces.

There are 3 interfaces in the `src/main/java` folder. You should implement the methods in the interfaces in the `src/main/java` folder within the 3 concrete implementations in the `src/main/java` folder.

Don't overthink it, look to build as simple as possible. Your code should be able to run the  test cases in the test folder.

The point of this lab is to consider the abstractions and how you implement them. You should be able to implement the methods in the interfaces with the methods in the concrete classes. This gives confidence, that sometimes, you don't need to write a lot of code to get the job done. 

It also gives you a chance to see how the Java Collections Framework is implemented. And how to use it to implement your own data structures in a simple fashion. 
And HEY, you also get to work with implementing a generic concrete class. 
(Which can be hard to find a reason to practice with writing generics.)
